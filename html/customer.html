                <p>We really love the service. From the beginning until the end, we were really happy
                     with Mr.Samuel and our driver. Both of them were nice to us, very helpful and friendly, and most importantly is they always smile. When we went for shopping, Mr.Samuel was with us all the time and never complained, made sour face or told us to hurry.
                    He was good with the kids too.
                    I definitely will recommend Backyard Travel to my friends. Thumbs up.

                <p>Originally it was to be me and one other on this trip of a lifetime.
                    Both my friend was injured a few weeks before our scheduled departure date and could not make the trip. I have never had a problem traveling alone and since Backyard Travel and I had already closely worked with me on the itinerary so all I needed to do was just go. Every step of the way, every new destination there was someone waiting on me to make sure I had
                    the experience I was expecting. You cannot go wrong with Backyard Travel service

                <p>Absolutely! Adventurous was amazing and helped me build my
                    personalized itinerary from scratch with all the activities
                    that I was most interested in. We worked together through the
                    “What’s App” app. He was very responsive and readily available,
                    energetic, supportive, and became a good friend in the process!
                    What an awesome trip it was!
